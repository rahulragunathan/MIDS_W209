## Introduction

Water is a natural resource necessary for human life; however, due to the developed water supply system and (usually) abundant rainfall in the United States, many Americans do not frequently think about where their water comes from, how it is used, and how much is left. It is often taken for granted that water just flows out of the faucet on command. Easily visualizing the extent of the water distribution can help with public comprehension of this limited resource.
